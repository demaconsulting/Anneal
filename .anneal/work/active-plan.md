# Migration: from prose agents to compiled processes

This file is the approved proposal every Migration commit references. It exists only while the
migration is in flight; the commit landing the final stage deletes it. It lived at root
`MIGRATION.md` through stage S20; S21 relocated it here without changing its content, as the last
step of making `.anneal/` the sole authoritative source for this repository's own process documents.

## Destination

Anneal becomes its own agent CLI. Work arrives at any point on the complexity spectrum, a router
classifies it and selects one of a catalog of processes, and each process runs as C# state-flow
logic — models do the work, and oracles, meaning narrow typed questions with no side effects, decide
its branches. The prose agents under `.github/agents/` are the bootstrap harness that made this
reachable, and they are dismantled into that catalog. `helper` and `architecture-design` are
absorbed last, because a conversation is the hardest control flow to encode — not because they are
exempt.

The dividing line in [`../governance/vision.md`](../governance/vision.md) holds for the
whole journey: control flow and context assembly become code, judgement stays data. Absorbing an
agent means compiling its loop, never its opinions; its prose becomes content a model is shown.

**Nothing below this altitude is scheduled, and no system documents are written for the
destination.** Contracts for systems that do not exist yet are the speculative documentation this
process refuses, and a tree grows a node only when the node is earned.

## How this migration is planned

**One stage at a time, written the morning it starts.** A stage is one day's work, chosen from the
state of the repository at that moment rather than from a plan made before the work began. Once it
lands, its entry is **deleted from this file**, not archived here — the commit that landed it is the
permanent record, and this file holds only the current or next stage plus the invariants that
constrain every stage regardless of content.

A forward schedule was rejected outright rather than written and amended. The restructuring is
exploratory: prose agents are split, merged and renamed on the way into the catalog, and the shape
of the catalog is decided from work done and success rates observed, not predicted. A sequence
written now would be fiction that later stages would be measured against, and the deeper hazard is
that a plan carries authority once it exists — a discovered better route reads as a deviation from
it rather than as the finding it is.

What replaces the schedule is the invariants below. They constrain every step whatever the step
turns out to be, which a stage list cannot do, because a surprise invalidates a list and cannot
invalidate an invariant.

Stages remain, and the vocabulary is unchanged, because `apply` reads a stage and its exit condition
from this file and `change-classification.md` requires one per stage. Only the forward schedule is
gone.

## Step invariants

These hold after **every** commit, not merely at a stage boundary.

- **Self-hosting** — every commit leaves Anneal able to develop Anneal. Each generation of the
  process builds the next one, so a change that breaks the agents currently doing the work stops the
  migration rather than advancing it. This is the constraint that decides what a stage may contain,
  and it is registered in [constraints.md](constraints.md) rather than owned here.
- **One-way** — a responsibility that has moved from prose into code does not move back. The ratchet
  is what makes an unscheduled migration safe: with no plan to measure against, monotonic direction
  is the only guarantee that a day's work is progress.
- **No silent loss** — behavior a prose agent had that its replacement does not carry is written into
  the commit message that drops it. Deliberately narrowing scope is legitimate; discovering months
  later that something was quietly lost is not.
- **Suspensions are named** — a promise the migration is not keeping appears in the register below,
  with the condition that restores or retires it. There is no unrecorded relaxation, because a
  silently weakened check is worse than no check.

## Suspension register

Contract clauses this migration cannot keep as written, and what holds in their place. Each is keyed
to a **condition**, never to a stage number, so that replanning cannot strand one.

The register is deliberately short. Most of the structural contract is unaffected by this migration
and is doing useful work throughout it: `PROCESS-01` through `PROCESS-04`, `PROCESS-07` and
`PROCESS-09` keep passing across a rename and are precisely what catches a botched one, and
`PROCESS-I1` is untouched because the mechanical agents were never entry points. They are not
suspended, and suspending them would remove the migration's safety net at the moment it is most
needed. `TOOLKIT-I1` is no longer listed here either: [model-seam.md](../architecture/toolkit/model-seam.md)
retired it when the first writing workers landed and replaced it with `TOOLKIT-I6`, whose explicit
allowlist and path-containment guarantees are the current invariant.

**`TOOLKIT-I3`** — a verdict is reproducible from repository inputs.

- *Cannot hold because* model-backed judgement is not a pure function of the repository.
- *What holds instead*: it holds unchanged for every deterministic operation, which is all that
  gates today.
- *Restored, scoped* to deterministic operations when the first model-backed operation gates.

**[overview.md](../architecture/overview.md)** — every edge is a file, never a call.

- *Cannot hold because* prose agents invoke `dotnet anneal`, and the catalog is reached by calling
  it.
- *What holds instead*: the edge is recorded as a call and confined to the Toolkit boundary.
- *Rewritten, not restored*, when Process is dissolved and the rule has nothing left to describe.

One clause is not suspended but is a live trip-wire worth naming: `PROCESS-03` requires every
standard to be reachable by an agent, so deleting a prose agent that was the only file naming a
standard fails the build. That is the check working. The repair is to relocate the standard or
retire it with the agent — never to silence the clause.

## Current stage

None open.
